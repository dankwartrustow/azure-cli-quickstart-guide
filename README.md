# azure-cli-quickstart-guide

This is a guide to getting started with the Azure CLI. 

The tool is made available to you via the Azure portal, via Node-JS Legacy (Azure CLI 1.0), and Python (Azure CLI 2.0).
In addition, these commands will work via PowerShell when the Azure Modules are setup on Powershell 5. 

Following this guide is suggested for automation purposes, and a -v command will allow you to see the verbose APIs. 
We should look to apply DevOps mentality into our work in order to deploy safely, replicably, and automate the boring stuff.
